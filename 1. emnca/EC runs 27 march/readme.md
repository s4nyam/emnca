# Particularly this rule is not aesthetically appealing :/
Generation:  199
Best Individual: 
[[(0.178, 0.242, 0)], [(0.868, 0.872, 0)], [(0.11, 0.301, 0)]]
Best Fitness:

# But we can see the logs and find which rule had resulted the maximul fitness?
# There is a chance that some rule had higher fitness value than that of final best, right?
# It may be because of selection? may be because of fitness value is not same for the same rule always?
# Let us pick a rule that had fitness slightly higher than the one that we had found, and the rule that stays near to the best found rule is:
