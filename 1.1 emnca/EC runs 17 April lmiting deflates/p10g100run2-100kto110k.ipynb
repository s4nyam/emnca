    "The roulette selection function now takes two additional input parameters, lower_limit_fitness and upper_limit_fitness, that define the range of fitness values to be considered during selection. The function first sorts the population based on its fitness values, just like before. It then filters out the fitness values that lie within the specified range using a for loop and the fitness_in_range list. If there are no fitness values in the specified range, the function returns lowest. Next, the function calculates the total fitness of the filtered population, calculates the probability of selection for each individual, and calculates the cumulative probability of selection for each individual, using only the fitness values within the specified range. Finally, it generates a random number and selects the individual whose cumulative probability of selection is the first one to exceed the random number, using a for loop and the fitness_in_range list. This modified selection function ensures that only individuals with fitness values within the specified range are considered during selection, while still following the basic principles of roulette wheel selection."
